Style Guides

Preface
=======

The style guide of the Python programming language,
`PEP-8 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0008>`__, quoted Ralph Waldo Emerson

*'A Foolish Consistency is the Hobgoblin of Little Minds'*.

Therefore, the guidelines in this document are not absolute.
Paraphrasing PEP-8, here are some useful advice for working with style
guides.

#. When in doubt, use your best judgement instead of following style
   guides unquestioningly

#. Look at other examples and decide what works best for yourself

#. Don't hesitate to ask others to help judge your style.

#. Don't rewrite earlier works just to comply to a style guide

And two extra items apply in the academic context

#. If an academic publisher prescribes its own style guide, it
   automatically takes highest precedence so the chance that your
   publication is accepted will be maximized

#. It may be reasonable to comply with the style in an influential piece
   of previous work. Even so, consider seeking a compromise,
   e.g. preserving their choice of symbols but adopting our typeface
